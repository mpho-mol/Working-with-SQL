The w3schools website's SQL browser IDE was used to write and test the following SQL coded which was then copied into a file named student.txt. Firstly, SQL code was written to create a table named Student with the stipulated attributes where STU_NUM is the primary key. Then queries were written to enter the first two rows which contain the information of two students as demonstrated in Screenshot (19).png. On assumption that all the data in the Student table has been entered as shown in Screenshot (20).png, the SQL code that lists all the attributes for a COURSE_CODE of 305. SQL code to delete the entire row of the student named Jamie Lannister was written by using logical operators to include all of the information. In order to change PROJ_NUM to 14 for all the students who started before the 1st of January 2016 and whose course code is at least 201, SQL code was written. The SQL code was written to delete all of the data inside the table, but not the actual table. Finally, the SQL code to delete the Student table entirely was written.
